    <article id="intro">
      <p>welcome to articulate, a multimedia periodical about the humanity of fonts.
        <br><br>
        this issue is about fonts born in the wrong era: a child prodigy that found fun once it shed the practicalities of his profession, a twee teen  nostalgic for a time she never knew, and an old soul that took decades to find their youth.

      <p class="body-text">
        Moore Computer (they/them) was part of a wave of fonts designed to be detected by magnetic ink character recognition (MICR). You know the first one - <a href="https://www.digitalcheck.com/what-is-e13b-font/" target="_blank">E-13B</a>, the numbers-only font that lets machines read the digits at the bottom of your checks. Its characteristic traits - right angles, square holes, tumorous strokes, variably cramped and cavernous spacing - started as a practical necessity but grew to be a symbol of "technology."
        <br><br>
        Somewhere in between then and now, though, that image got flipped on its head. Moore Computer, once a vision of modernity, now speaks completely in the retro tense. How?
        <br><br>
        When viewed at a glance, a distant point on the horizon might resemble the future. But as time moves forward, that point comes nearer and nearer until one day we're looking at it in the unflattering, skin-wrinkling, belly-bloating rearview mirror. Fonts like Moore Computer that articulate “the future” as a specific design inevitably meet this fate. Their vision for an upcoming reality may turn out right or wrong, but either way it turns <em>out</em>. 
        <br><br>
        Predicting the future is hard work, though, and should be left in the professional hands of storefront psychics and insider traders. Once Moore Computer was released from the burden to be <em>right</em> and <em>now</em>, they were able to be themself.
        <br><br>
        When I see Moore Computer hawking their wares in vintage Etsy stores and posing for selfies on '70s IG moodboards, I see a <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/43460/pizza-planet-spaceport-entry-in-toy-story-199" target="_blank">playfulness</a> that was missing when they were the spokesperson for <a href="moore-computer-computer-programming.webp" target="_blank">computer manuals</a> and <a href="moore-computer-appliance.webp" target="_blank">appliance advertisements</a>. Their value isn't conditional on their technical abilities - people love them for who they are. 
        <br><br>
        Life moves pretty fast and technology moves even faster. I'm glad Moore Computer was finally able to slow down and enjoy it.

    <article id="egyptienne">
      <img class="width-100p" src="egyptienne.png">
      <p class="body-text">
        Many fonts hit the ground running. Most reflect their era's aesthetic, and a lucky few define it. Not Egyptienne (he/him). Egyptienne peaked late. Not a 5th-year-senior, “I know all the moves,” slippery, sinisterly suave late peak. Egyptienne was a foreign exchange student from another time, lucky enough to be well received but never totally understood.
        <br><br>
        No one is quite sure when Egyptienne was born - some say 1820, others 1851. Egyptienne was born in the time before birthdays, when people were too busy toiling in fields and being generally itchy to write down a birthday. But after a century and a half in the flip-over pages of typeface catalogs, Egyptienne moved to the big city and blew up. All of a sudden, it was on album covers and movie posters and newsstands.
        <br><br>
        Why? Egyptienne is bold and self-assured. It has enough character to be interesting at large sizes. And yet it remains readable at small ones. When the Dutch celebrate Sinterklaas<sup>1</sup> on Sinterklaas Eve, they give each other large chocolate bars in the shape of their initials. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_letter#cite_note-Chocolate_letter_font-1">Egyptienne is typically the font</a>. It's fun enough to fit a festive spirit, but legible enough to be printed in industrial quantities of melty, waxy chocolate.
        <br><br>
        Egyptienne reminds me of the suits men wore to the office in the 70s. While still formal, they were bolder than the white collar workwear of previous decades: wider lapels, flared legs, brighter colors. This balance between restrained formality and fashion-forward creativity makes sense in the contexts Egyptienne thrived: the covers of hip social commentary magazines like <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/30730/new-york-magazine-1960s-1970s">New York Magazine</a> and <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/16766/fact-magazine-covers">Fact</a>. Intellectual but provocative, cerebral but visceral. It's a good thing it waited those 150 years - when its time came, Egyptienne was a perfect fit.
