      this issue is about fonts born in the wrong era: a child prodigy who found fun once they shed the practicalities of their profession, a twee teen nostalgic for a time she never knew, and an old soul that took decades to find his youth.

        Moore Computer (they/them) was part of a wave of fonts designed to be detected by magnetic ink character recognition (MICR). You know the first one - <a href="https://www.digitalcheck.com/what-is-e13b-font/" target="_blank">E-13B</a>, the numbers-only font that lets machines read the digits at the bottom of your checks. Its characteristic traits - right angles, square holes, tumorous strokes, variably cramped and cavernous spacing - started as a practical necessity but grew to be a symbol of "technology."
        <br><br>
        Somewhere between then and now, though, that image got flipped on its head. Moore Computer, once a vision of modernity, now speaks completely in the retro tense. How?

        When viewed at a glance, a distant point on the horizon might resemble the future. But as time moves forward, that point comes nearer and nearer until one day we're looking at it in the unflattering, skin-wrinkling, belly-bloating rearview mirror. Fonts like Moore Computer that articulate “the future” as a specific design inevitably meet this fate. Their vision for an upcoming reality may turn out right or wrong, but either way it turns <em>out</em>. 
        <br><br>
        Predicting the future is hard work, though, and should be left in the professional hands of storefront psychics and insider traders. Once Moore Computer was released from the burden to be <em>right</em> and <em>now</em>, they were able to be themself.

      <p>
        When I see Moore Computer hawking their wares in vintage Etsy stores and posing for selfies on '70s IG moodboards, I see a <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/43460/pizza-planet-spaceport-entry-in-toy-story-199" target="_blank">playfulness</a> that was missing when they were the spokesperson for <a href="moore-computer-computer-programming.webp" target="_blank">computer manuals</a> and <a href="moore-computer-appliance.webp" target="_blank">appliance advertisements</a>. Their value isn't conditional on their technical abilities - people love them for who they are. 
        <br><br>
        Life moves fast and technology moves faster. It's a rare gift that Moore Computer was finally able to slow down and enjoy it.

        <p class="body-text">
          Any given Saturday night, you'll find <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/recoleta/">Recoleta</a> (b. 2018) in her bedroom (second floor, left of the stairs, if you hit the picture of Grandma and Grandpa in college you've gone too far). She's imaging a chiller life. Or maybe it's just different. But it certainly doesn't have the Common App website or follower counts or numbers at all for that matter. And certainly <em>certainly</em>  not Tim.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Recoleta may have been designed in the Trump era, but she was born in the wrong time. The 60s were for her. Or was it the 70s? When was Fleetwood Mac? Well… any of those times would be better than now. There'd be neighborhood kids, no one would ask her about college, she'd fit in, and sleep would just be the time in between montages.

          </div>
        <p class="body-text">
          Recoleta's type face is a spitting image of her style icons. That angled stroke in her lowercase “e” - that's pure <a href="https://assets.fontsinuse.com/static/use-media-items/53/52451/upto-700xauto/5922b8cf/@2x/our-earth-our-cure.webp">Windsor</a> (the font in the Kate Bollinger album cover above). At heavier weights, Recoleta's rounded strokes and nib-y serifs are a splitting image of Cooper Black. Like so many fonts her age, Recoleta is torn between a thousand things and she's expected to have it all. These context switches can be tiring, to the point that Recoleta doesn't notice the skill she displays doing so.
          <br><br>
          If only she knew what her parents' friends say about her. How engaging she is. How she listens better than anyone her age should know how. And so elegant, too.
          <br><br>
          She'll get there soon.

    <article id="egyptienne">
      <img class="width-100p" class="article-header-image" src="egyptienne.png">
      <p class="body-text">
        Egyptienne (he/him) peaked late. Not a 5th-year-senior, “I know all the moves,” slippery, suave, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuER2Puym4I">"alright, alright, alright"</a> late peak. Egyptienne was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roRh_LqhgR4">foreign exchange student from another time</a>, lucky enough to be well received but never totally understood.
        <br><br>
        No one is quite sure when Egyptienne was born - <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/4027/egyptienne">some say 1820, others 1851</a>. Egyptienne was designed in the time before birthdays, when people were too busy toiling in fields and being generally itchy to write down a birthdate. But after a century and a half in the flip-over pages of typeface catalogs, Egyptienne moved to the big city and blew up. All of a sudden, it was on album covers and movie posters and newsstands.
        <br><br>
        Why? Egyptienne is bold and self-assured. It has enough character to be interesting at large sizes. And yet it remains readable at small ones. When the Dutch celebrate Sinterklaas<sup>1</sup> on Sinterklaas Eve, they give each other large chocolate bars in the shape of their initials. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_letter#cite_note-Chocolate_letter_font-1">Egyptienne is typically the font</a>. It's fun enough to fit a festive spirit, but legible enough to be printed in industrial quantities of melty, waxy chocolate.
        <div class="editorial-images ny-mag">
          <img src="New-York-Magazine-16-Aug-1976.webp">

        </div>
        Egyptienne reminds me of the suits men wore to the office in the 70s. While still formal, they were bolder than the white collar workwear of previous decades: wider lapels, flared legs, brighter colors. This balance between restrained formality and fashion-forward creativity makes sense in the contexts Egyptienne thrived: the covers of hip social commentary magazines like <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/30730/new-york-magazine-1960s-1970s">New York Magazine</a> and <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/16766/fact-magazine-covers">Fact</a>. Intellectual but provocative, cerebral but visceral.
        <br><br>
        It's a good thing he waited those 150 years - when his time came, Egyptienne was a perfect fit.
