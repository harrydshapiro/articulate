      <p class="body-text">
        When you read Pilowlava, the first thing you read is <span class="text-underline">Pilowlava</span>. Its bulbuous strokes jut out with a wonderfully haphazard and syncopated rhythm, and you've got to it read several times before you can tap your foot to it. Eventually you parse out its alphabet. There's a P, that's a W, what an interesting way to write an I. Only then do you actually read it. And in that latency between perceiving it and engaging with it, Pilowlava's attempt to communicate is lost.
        <br><br>
        In our time of tense high-stakes self-actualization, Pilowlava gets identity across effortlessly. It's great for applications where establishing and explaining oneself is the only goal: a sour beer's label, an upscale headshop's logo, a Pratt student's endearingly overdone web design portfolio. But once the sentence doesn't start with "I am," Pilowlava fumbles over its words. The letters dont quite fit in the eye, they certainly don't string together in a sentence, and when viewed as a large body of text they may as well be hieroglyphics.

    <!-- AVERIA SERVIF -->
    <article id="averia-serif">
      <img class="width-100p" src="averia-serif.jpeg">
      <p class="body-text">
        Averia Serif's designer had a vision - that's obvious. Under caving-in ceilings, in a room somehow dry and musty, among 2007 LSAT prep books and Kurt Vonnegut reprints, lies a used book store's collection of paper at various stages of yellowing. The Averia Serif letters died into them are regular but imperfect. Any description other than "booky" feels partial and tactical. Averia Serif is steeped in history: comfortable, human, personal.
        <br><br>
        But it's not. Averia Serif was <a href="http://iotic.com/averia/" target="_blank">generated by averaging all the glyphs on its creator's computer</a>. It is brown, static noise, Switzerland in wartime. It is an automated product: completely indifferent, lazily magnimous, and the lack of intention in letter and spirit.
        <br><br>
        That's the best part.
        <br><br>
        Typefaces promise that you can fit in and still be yourself. To have a life, they must conform to legibility. But to justify it, they must be unique. No typeface does this better than Averia Serif. It's defined entirely through its relationship with its peers, but speaks with a particular, self-assured voice.
