        this issue walks down the road between fashion (attainted through social associations) and style (attained through self-posession), pointing out representative fonts along the way.

        There is a point during a party, typically once 3 distinct conversational nuclei have formed, when walking in without full thrust will make you subconsciously yearn to shrink behind your mothers leg. There <em>they</em> are, over <em>there</em>, and here I am, jacketed and shoed, cardboard handle of the spiked seltzer six-pack digging into my sweaty palm, silently searching for a friend to take in my refugee eyes.
        <br><br>
        That is, of course, unless Vibro is hosting the party.
        <br><br>
        When you walk in the door Vibro - the one-of-a-kind hippie beauty who a second ago was giving their undivided attention to another striking, they-must-have-done-some-modelling friend - welcomes you with a yelp and a broad smile and outstretched arms. Right away Vibro is Vibro, and Vibro is so glad to see you.
        <br><br>
        Beauty can feel alien and inaccessible. How does Vibro manage to be both peerless and completely relatable?
        <br><br>
        Vibro does a great Wes Anderson impression, making room for her visually dense quirks by adhering to spare and essential geometric compositions. Her freeway lane strokes painted in staggered lines and circular arcs paradoxically force her into using the most simple shapes possible. Look at that C - have you ever seen as C a C as that? Or the W? 
        <br><br>
        A friend of a friend said that Susan Sontag said that “style is a means of insisting on something.” Vibro's style is so fun and organic that she somehow evades the need to insist on it.
