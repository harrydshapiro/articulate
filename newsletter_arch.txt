MOBILE ONLY - MOBILE ONLY - MOBILE ONLY

UX/UI

its good bc it
  looks cool
  is different
  does not come w/ connotations associated w/ bigger players
  feels more exclusive
  easter eggs? hidden shit?

so what if every high-scale user action was done using a SMS CLI?
  subscription mgmt
  receive new posts

TECHNICAL

upload to personal site
  this is the least frequent user action. it should be done manually by me.

view on personal site
  react, heroku?

subscription management
  can prob just be one table
    id, phone #, email, name, is_subscribed_phone, is_subscribed_email, created_at, deleted_at

post dissemination
  newsletters come in email format. this is lame. lets do text.
  ooooo.... let's do EVERYTHING in text.


ok what about a text disseminator, basically? im basically making twitter but w/ SMS
  text a feed name to the subscription mgmt number
    if the feed exists and you are not subscribed, you get subscribed
          TODO: think about how we will communicate the successful subscription
    if the feed exists and you are susbcribed, you get prompted to unsubscribe. if you say yes, you are unsubscribed
    
  the author of the feed is always able to text their feed number. when they do, that same phone number sends the messages to everyone who is subscribed.

  there is a unique phone # per feed
