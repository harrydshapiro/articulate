        When you read Pilowlava, the first thing you read is <span class="text-underline">Pilowlava</span>. Its bulbuous strokes just out with a wonderfully haphazard and syncopated rhythm, so you've got to it read several times before you can tap your foot to it. Eventually you parse out its alphabet. There's a P, that's a W, what an interesting way to write an I. Only then do you actually read it. In that latency between perceiving it and engaging with it, Pilowlava's attempt to communicate is lost.
        <br><br>
        Pilowlava can reliably get across is its own identity. It's great for applications where establishing and explaining oneself is the only goal: a sour beer's label, an upscale headshop's logo, a Pratt student's endearingly overdone web design portfolio. But once the sentence doesn't start with "I am," Pilowlava fumbles over its words. The letters dont quite fit in the eye, they certainly don't string together in a sentence, and when viewed as a large body of text they may as well be hieroglyphics.
