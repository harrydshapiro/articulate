        When I read Pilowlava, the first thing I read is <span class="text-underline">Pilowlava</span>. If you zone out a bit, the light strokes melt away and the heavy strokes jut out at haphazard angles. Eventually you parse out its alphabet.That's a P, there's a W, what an interesting way to write an I. Only then do you actually read it. This late in the game, Pilowlava's attempt to communicate is basically moot.
        <br><br>
        Pilowlava can reliably get across is its own identity. It's great for applications where establishing and explaining oneself is the only goal: a sour beer's label, an upscale headshop's logo, a Pratt student's endearingly overdone web design portfolio. But once the sentence doesn't start with "I am," Pilowlava fumbles over its words. The letters dont quite fit in the eye, they certainly don't string together in a sentence, and when viewed as a large body of text they may as well be hieroglyphics.
