        When you read Pilowlava, the first thing you read is <span class="text-underline">Pilowlava</span>. You run your eyes over its undulations and asymetries. You parse out its alphabet - that's a P, there's a W, what an interesting way to write an I.
        <br><br>
        Only then do you actually read it. This late in the game, Pilowlava's attempt to communicate is basically moot. Like a fashion show's charitable cause, its text is an easily forgettable excuse to be seen on display.
        <br><br>
        Pilowlava can reliably get across is its own identity. It's great for applications where establishing and explaining oneself is the only goal: a sour beer's label, an upscale Asheville, NC headshop's logo, a Pratt student's endearingly overdesigned web design portfolio. But once the sentence doesn't start with "I am," Pilowlava fumbles over its words. The letters dont quite fit in the eye, and they certainly don't string together in a sentence, and and when viewed as a large body of text they may as well be hieroglyphics.
