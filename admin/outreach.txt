## TEMPLATES

Hi,

I run articulate.gallery, a website about the humanity of fonts. I’m writing to you because ____________________.

Our goal is to get laypeople to think about fonts like you do: as intimate, personified, living beings. We communicate a font’s personality in many ways, including:
- Pseudo-biographical prose
- Playlists
- Infographics
- Social media accounts on behalf of fonts
- A font’s fake bank statement
- Plenty of photos

<Reminder of the reason why I’m reaching out>

Thanks so much,
Harry Shapiro
