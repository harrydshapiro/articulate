## TEMPLATES

Hi,

I run articulate.gallery, a website about the humanity of fonts. I’m writing to you because ____________________.

// Ugh.... I don't like any of this...
Our goal is to get laypeople to think about fonts like you do: as animate, living beings. We personalize fonts using all kinds of media:
- Pseudo-biographical prose
- Playlists
- Infographics
- Social media accounts on behalf of fonts
- A font’s fake bank statement
- Plenty of photos
- Really anything else we can think of

<Reminder of the reason why I’m reaching out>

Thanks so much,
Harry Shapiro
