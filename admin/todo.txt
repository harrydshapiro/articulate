## ADMIN
[ ] Define a formal schedule for all work *except for* content generation
    - Probably need to block this out on a calendar

## PARTNERSHIPS
[ ] Find someone who can talk to me about my marketing goals
    - Ideally someone who knows how to 1) define an audience 2) optimize social media outreach to that audience
[ ] Find someone to help me with the graphic design of 1) web 2) print
    - Really I'm looking for someone to help me with defining a design process and tool selection/learning
    - I don't really need help with the design, although if they want to take that off my plate I'd be more than happy for them to :)
[ ] Find someone to talk with about the LOE for zine printing and distribution
[ ] Generally connect with the folks who run fontsinuse

## MARKETING 
[ ] Define the audience(s)
    - I only care about something if it actually defines the audience, but here are some example considerations:
        - Age
        - Gender
        - Aesthetic
        - Where do they live?
        - What social media accounts, podcasts, books, websites, food do they consume?
        - What's their job?
        - What's their education?
[ ] Start sharing the site publicly:
    - r/fonts
    - r/typography
    - r/graphic_design
    - r/design
    - https://typedrawers.com/
    - https://typography.guru/forums/forum/2-talk/
[ ] After defining audience(s), shift to:
    - How do I find new followers in a cost-efficient manner?
    - How do I reach existing followers in a cost efficient manner?
    - Do I want a different audience? How might I do that?
    - How does each audience like to consume content like mine?

## TECH INITIATIVES
[ ] Add cloudfront cacheing
[ ] Turn site into a react app
    - Core goals:
        - DRY up HTML/CSS
        - Improve mobile and desktop experience - there's some small little graphic weirdnesses
[ ] More nuanced user tracking:
    - define specific events
    - have better tracking of upstream traffic sources
[ ] Force HTTPS
